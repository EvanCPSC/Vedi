# Vedi

Vedi is a velocity and direction mobile app without GPS implementation
<hr>

This was a high school project for our Mobile App Development class. Contributors include:

* [Seamus](https://github.com/ThompsonSeamus)
* [Jose](https://github.com/MaldonadoJo)
* [And me](https://github.com/EvanCPSC)

This class was right after AP Computer Science A, so we used Java and Android Studio to develop it

I have brought it back to life to finish it
